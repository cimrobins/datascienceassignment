import wbgapi as wb   # Accessing World Bank API
import pandas as pd   # Data handling and manipulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   # Data visualization
import heatmapz   # Creating heatmaps
import requests   # Making API requests
%matplotlib inline  # Ensures plots appear directly in the notebook
